# OC - Les Petits Plats

7th project for Openclassrooms' Front-End Javascript/React dev course.

## The project

* Main point: Developping a search algorithm for a fictional platform of cooking recipes
* Conceive the user interface in HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS, focus on it being intuitive and the search function being reactive
* Main tasks:
  * Create two versions of a search algorithm, able to sort and filter a JSON data file. In this case, these two methods were used:
    * Algorithm v1 uses native Javascript loops functions
    * Algorithm v2 uses array manipulating methods such as map, filter and sort.
  * Analyse and compare the two algorithms, in terms of rapidity, smoothness, code maintainability etc. 
  * After testing, choose the better algorithm for the case & document the tests and reason for choosing one over the other

## Getting Started

### Installing

No pre-requisites needed. Just fork the repo or download the code in ZIP form.

### Executing program

To test the two algorithms:
Open the folder in VSCode or your preferred editor, git checkout to the branchs "algo1" or "algo2", then using a Live Server extension, start up the live server. Or just click on the index.html file.
